# go23_course
## Excercise 6 and excercise 7

## Usage
Start the server by using this command for running 
```
go run main.go
```
For API usage please help to import swagger file in [docs](docs/) folder to [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) or [Swagger Hub](https://app.swaggerhub.com/home) for more information.
You can also use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) for testing the API by importing [postman collection](docs/postman_collection.json) file in [docs](docs/) folder.
I will update the API usage using swagger UI later.

To test the repository, please use this command
```
go test ./test
```
